    <h2>Context and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      From the beginning of this course, I noticed that I did not really have the understanding I wanted to have about ancient mythology. One of the assignments allowed me to look at Ovid's telling of Medusa's story. This quickly led me to realize that I wanted to know more if some gods or mythological figures that I had held preconceived notions about were vastly different from the way I and most people viewed them. At this time, I was traveling abroad in Paris and Rome. Even though it was tougher to think about the project, seeing art pieces and architecture that resembled the subject matter of this course helped a ton. Last semester, I learned how to build a website for my organization and found it quite enjoyable, so I decided that I would like to create a new one for not only this project, but also potentially for some sort of personal portfolio. I really wanted to build on the skills I developed during the school year. This is how I started Blurred Myths. Throughout the semester, I learned more about Odysseus and really started to question his morals. Originally, I only wanted to deep dive into Medusa's story, but after reading the Odyssey, I wanted to look into Odysseus and Zeus, as they were questionable in my opinion. I also remember loving Hades as a child, but I did not end up having enough time to add him into this project. In the future, however, I would love to incorporate him as well as Athena into the website! Maybe I could add some sort of survey to the home page to see what the users' opinions are about Greek and Roman gods. The most challenging part of completing this project was figuring out how I wanted to organize a project. I didn't know how I wanted each page to look and what kind of information to add on each page. To overcome this, I sat down for around 2 hours and created a mind map and then eventually a sample website on paper. This really allowed me to visualize my ideas before I started to code. Once I started coding, I was able to get things going relatively fast. The entirety of each page took around a day to complete. Because I was able to code for my organization at UT, I felt confident that I would complete the project on time. However, I was unable to complete the work in a timely manner due to travel and other circumstances. Nevertheless, I am glad and mostly satisfied with the work I have done.
