    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Medusa is depicted as a monstrous figure in Greek and Roman mythology, one of three Gorgon sisters born to sea gods.
      According to Apollodorus, Medusa "had heads with scaly serpents coiled around them,
      and large tusks like those of swine, and hands of bronze, and wings of gold which gave
      them the power of flight" (2.4.2). It was also noted that whoever looked at her would turn into stone.

    <h2>Modern View</h2>
    <p>
      Medusa is largely viewed as horrifying and monstrous. She is shown in literature and other forms of entertainment, mostly in the 20th and 21st centuries. In these, she acts as a symbol of chaos and danger as her monstrous qualities are highlighted. In my personal experience in reading the Percy Jackson Series, she was shown to be one of the ultimate monsters to be slain.

    <h2>Evidence and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
       Even though her reputation paints her as a monster throughout history, evidence shows that Medusa is more so a victim of a tragedy. To begin, Medusa's portrayal as "evil" is solely derived from the way she looks. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, it states, "She was once most beautiful, and the jealous aspiration of many suitors. Of all her beauties none was more admired than her hair: I came across a man who recalled having seen her" (Ov. Metamorphoses 5.753-803). This shows that Medusa, at one point, was beautiful and normal. It does not speak of her having any ill intentions. It then states that, "Neptune, lord of the seas, violated her in the temple of Minerva. Jupiter’s daughter turned away, and hid her chaste eyes behind her aegis. So that it might not go unpunished, she changed the Gorgon’s hair to foul snakes. And now, to terrify her enemies, numbing them with fear, the goddess wears the snakes, that she created, as a breastplate" (Ov. Metamorphoses 5.753-803). This transformation that Ovid's Metamorphoses speaks of describes her monstrous looks as a result of injustice against her. Medusa was punished for something done against her by Minerva, or Athena. This shows that Medusa was unjustly punished because of Poseidon's, or Neptune's, crimes and was forced to live under terrifying physical consequences. Moreover, her life could only be lived in loneliness as human interaction became deadly. This is not because of her choice, but rather because of the choices of Athena and Poseidon. Now, her powers to turn people into stone serve as a symbol of the unfair consequences of injustice.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The narrative given by Ovid shows Medusa as the complete opposite of evil. The forever scarring transformation of Medusa allows us to reevaluate her traditional reputation from evil to good. She was fiercely wronged due to the harmful desires of those more powerful than her.
