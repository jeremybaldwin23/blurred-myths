    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Odysseus is the King of Ithaca, son of Laertes and Anticleia, husband to Penelope, and father of Telemachus. He is a central figure in Homer's epic poems, The Iliad and The Odyssey. 
      He is renowned for his intelligence, eloquence, resourcefulness, courage, and endurance. His most famous exploits include devising the Trojan Horse, which led to the fall of Troy, and his arduous ten-year journey home after the war, fraught with encounters with monsters, gods, and mortal challenges.

    <h2>Modern View</h2>
    <p>
      Odysseus is mostly viewed as mostly good and a hero.

    <h2>Evidence and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      In today's world, we often think of Odysseus as a clever hero with much perseverance. However, if
      we look into ancient texts, we can find out much more. Odysseus is not viewed as a typical hero, rather,
      he is viewed as a cunning warrior who decieves and will do anything to survive.
      Traditionally, Odysseus was also viewed as a national hero due to his unwavering nostos or his determination
      to return home in Ithaca. When he was asked to stay with Circe and be immortal with her, he turns it down so that 
      one day he will be able to return home to his wife Penelope (Hom. Od. 5.203-222). This allows me to understand the fuel
      that drives Odysseus throught the Odyssey and understand his character a little bit better.
      Odysseus is also very strategic. He utilizes his intellect to escape the Cyclops Polyphemus by getting him drunk
      and then blinding him (Hom. Od. 9.347-506). He also strategically steered between Scylla and Charybdis so that he would not lose
      his and all his mens lives (Hom. Od. 12.223-259). Lastly, throughout the Odyssey, Athena, the goddess of wisdom, provides help to Odysseus.
      Athena actively helps Odysseus during the battle against the suitors. The Odyssey states, "Again the suitors threw their weapons; again Athena made them fail"
      (Hom. Od. 22.272-273). Due to this divine intervention, it is reasonable to beleive that, in the Homeric wordlview, Odysseus has at least some qualities that are good.

      Now, we can look at some of the possible flaws of Odysseus. Known for his deceptiveness, we can take a look at his integrity. The Odyssey mentions Odysseus's most famous
      trick: the Trojan Horse. It states, "How tough he was! And what impressive fortitude he showed inside the Wooden Horse! We fighters lurked 
      inside, to bring destruction to the Trojans" (Hom. Od. 4.271-273). Another example of Odysseus's sneaky nature is when he lies to Eumaeus when he says, "I will 
      tell you the truth, the whole truth. How I wish two could sit at ease here in this cottage,
      and we had food and sweet strong wine to last as long as we desired, while all the work 
      was done by others! Even if I talked a whole year, I would not complete the story of everything the gods have made me suffer. 
      Proudly I say, I come from spacious Crete, the son of wealthy Castor Hylacides, whose sons by his main wife were numerous, raised in his house. My mother was a slave,
      bought as a concubine, and yet my father spected me like all his other sons" (Hom. Od. 14.191-204). Odysseus is claiming to be a Cretan and lies about his backstory.
      Even though this works, Odysseus's reliance on lies and lying to those who are loyal to him, causes concerns. Odysseus also is famously known for his merciless execution of those who are
      disloyal to him. He says, “I refuse to grant these girls
a clean death, since they poured down shame on me
and Mother, when they lay beside the suitors.”
At that, he wound a piece of sailor’s rope
round the rotunda and round the mighty pillar,
stretched up so high no foot could touch the ground.
As doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly
home to their nests, but someone sets a trap—
they crash into a net, a bitter bedtime;
just so the girls, their heads all in a row,
were strung up with the noose around their necks
to make their death an agony. They gasped,
feet twitching for a while, but not for long" (Hom. Od. 22.462-474).

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I believe that Odysseus's modern view is mostly wrong. Although he is heroic in the sense that he utilizes his mindful strengths and intellect to outsmart enemies, get his way, and do some good things,
      he has a lot of grey areas. He is no where near perfect, exhibits much pride, deceitfulness, and selfishness. He will do whatever it take to get his own way. Therefore, I find it very hard to give him the title of "Good."
