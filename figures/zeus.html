    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Zeus is known as the supreme Olympian god and the father and king of all immortals and mortals. 
      He is known to be the one who maintains order both in the heavens and down in earth. Zeus wields a thunderbolt, 
      which acts a symbol of power over the natural world and his authority over all.

    <h2>Modern View</h2>
    <p>
      Zeus is very recognizable in the modern world. He is very popular
      in entertainment and books throughout history. He is depicted as very strong, powerful, and full of justice. 
      However, Zeus is no longer viewed as a god for worship but now one that is 
      vengeful and sometimes full of wrath.

    <h2>Evidence and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      As the "God of Xenios" or the God of strangers, Zeus is depicted as the guardian of sacred laws. 
      Early in Emily Wilson's Odyssey, Zeus states, "This is absurd, that mortals blame the gods! They say we cause their suffering, but they themselves increase it by folly" (Odyssey, 1.32-35). 
      This immediately introduces the complex nature of Zeus. He's a protector, yet he also is harsh in demanding human accountability.
      This complexity is reinforced when Odysseus appeals to the Cyclops, stating, "We are your suppliants, and Zeus is on our side, since he takes care of visitors, guest-friends, and those in need" (Odyssey, 9.269-271). 
      Here, Zeus is shown as a god who cares for the vulnerable and demonstrates xenia through his support for Odysseus. Throughout the poem, Zeus provides his support through thunderclaps, which serve as direct signals of his will. 
      For instance, in Book 20, "Zeus, Lord of Cunning, heard him, and he thundered from bright Olympus, high above the clouds; Odysseus was happy" (Odyssey, 20.104-106). Later, as Odysseus prepares for his vengeance, "The suitors, horrified, grew pale, and Zeus made ominous thunder rumble. 
      Odysseus, who had so long been waiting, was glad to hear the signal from the son of double-dealing Cronus" (Odyssey, 21.412-416). These thunderclaps are direct showings of Zeus's power, signifying his support for the punishment of the suitors who have violated xenia.
      On the other hand, Zeus, also shows himself to be selfish and unjust. For example, in Apollodorus The Library, Zeus is said to engage in non-consensual sexual activity. It states, "Zeus had intercourse with her in the shape of a stream of gold which poured through the roof into Danae's lap".
      Zeus, through this, shows disregard for the revrence of marriage. Sometimes, Zeus also punishes his victims. For example, Semele, one of Zeus's mortal lovers is killed by his firery storm. It states, "But still Semele’s mortal body could not endure the storm, and she was consumed, by the fire of her nuptial gift" (Ovid Book 3.273-315).
      Through his actions, Zeus causes the suffering of those he interacts with even in the mortal realm.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion, Zeus's reputation should be largely reevaluated. Throught his biggest moral flaw of adultery
      he proves that he is deceitful, abuses his power, and disregards the suffering he causes.
      There is no doubt that he is powerful and untamed. 
      However, Zeus is a force that can be devastating and wrong according to human perception, even as he upholds the fundamental order of the cosmos.
